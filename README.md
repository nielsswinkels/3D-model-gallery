# 3D-model-gallery

A viewer/gallery for browsing 3D models (.glb files)

## How to run
To run it in dev mode:
npm start

To build it out to windows exe file:
npm run dist

Then open the /dist/ folder. In there you will find a .exe that is an installer. You can also just take the win-unpacked folder and distribute that (zip it if you want to give it to someone for example). Place your models in the /models/ folder.
